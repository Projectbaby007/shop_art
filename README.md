## AUTHORS

This team is made up of 3 members;

1. Caleb E. Oru

2. Nwanochiri GloriaMary Ogochukwu

3. Joseph Alfred Ukpaka


Caleb and Joseph handled the code/script writing and API implementation and web frameworks, Ogochukwu took care of the graphics and video editing while Ogochukwu and Caleb will handled the front end. The reason for this division of labor is to play to each one of our strengths and pursuing this project will also allow us to learn.

## TECHNOLOGIES

For this project, We’d use HTML, CSS & Javascript. Python scripts will be exercised for the backend with the Javascript initiated for the front end. Bootstrap Studio will also be employed for the design of the website. Web frameworks like Flask and Django might be explored too. We’re keeping our options open.


## CHALLENGE STATEMENT

This project is intended to provide an easier way for the demand and supply of artworks by creating a website and app to curb such issues. This website isn’t intended to be for information about art in general.


## RISKS

Technical risks involved in this project might include the following:
Higher costs in the long run
Slow page speed.
Limited ability to scale
Low conversions
Integration issues

* To mitigate those risks, we’ve opted to
Start with an MVP
Be agile
Address technical risks early
Improve SEO by targeting keywords with high commercial intent, creating linkable assets, and using site links.
Communicate with my team frequently
Rank potential risks and specify desired outcomes


## INFRASTRUCTURE
 
1. Branching and Merging Strategy:
'GitHub flow' will be considered, it involves creating branches for new features or bug fixes, making changes in those branches, and then merging them back into the main branch (usually called "master" or "main"). This strategy allows for easy collaboration and ensures that the main branch remains stable. Additionally, we will establish code review practices to ensure quality and be able to catch any issues before merging branches.
 
2. Deployment Strategy:
The strategy for deployment will depend on the specific requirements and preferences of the team. But some deployment strategy to be considered is the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. These pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to set up and manage these pipelines. Our main aim in selecting any strategy will be to automate the deployment process to ensure consistency and efficiency.
 
3. Data Population:
To populate the app with data, the team can consider several approaches. One option is to manually enter the data through an administrative interface or backend API. This approach is suitable for smaller datasets or when the data is static. Another option is to import data from external sources or use data seeding scripts to automatically populate the database. This approach is practical when dealing with larger datasets or when data needs to be regularly updated. The specific method of data population will depend on the requirements of the project.
 
4. Testing Tools and Automation:
To ensure the quality and reliability of the application, the team will establish a testing process suitable for each programming language/framework as time goes on. This can include unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. For example, in Python, you can use tools like pycodestyle or unit test for unit testing, and tools like Selenium or Cypress for end-to-end testing. Automation of tests can be achieved through test automation frameworks or by incorporating testing into the CI/CD pipeline mentioned earlier. As work progress, the team will define the testing strategy, including what types of tests to conduct and how to automate them.
